##Manage translations with CPhpMessageSource

This module creates a user interface to translate your message files.  
Your application must be setup to use messages CPhpMessageSource.  
Check **Resources** for links with information about this.

##Requirements

Tested with Yii 1.1.10.


##Configuration

Edit your config file and add or change these lines:

~~~
[php]
.........
'modules'=>array(
    .........
    'TranslatePhpMessage' => array(
        'encoding' => 'UTF-8', //encoding used to save messages
        'excludedirs' => array(), //directories to exclude
        'excludefiles' => array(), //files to exclude
        ),
    .........
    ),
.........
// default Yii language, CHANGE to your language
'language' => 'en_us', 
~~~

Every directory under `/protected/messages/` should have **777** permissions (Unix only).  

##How to use

Extract the file to `protected/modules`.  
Create a link to `'/TranslatePhpMessage')` or navigate to `index.php?r=TranslatePhpMessage`  

This module assumes that the developer mantains the default language files, all operations are based of that files, so keep them in order.  
  
The module displays an error if it cant find the directories where message files are stored.  
Ideally you will have at least two directories (default language, other language).  
 If not you will get a warning, until you create them manually, there isn't any functionalty for that.

Choose the language you want to translate. You can choose the same language as the default to edit a source file.  
 The next screen shows two lists of files.  
 On the left the files you have. If you need a new file you must create it manually  
 On the right shows what files are missing (you can create a new blank file).  
  
Again, this lists refer to the default language, so no missing files will show if you are editing the default language.  
If you need a file not found on either list you must create it manualy in the default language directory.  
Just make sure the file contains:  
  
~~~
[php]
<?php
return array()
?>
~~~

The translate view compares between your default language and the language you choose.  
  To translate just write on the translation column and save.  
You can also insert new key=>value pairs in the default language message file
