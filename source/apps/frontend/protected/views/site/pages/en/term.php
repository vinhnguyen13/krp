    <h1><?php echo Lang::t('general', 'Terms & Conditions'); ?></h1>

    <p>Your use of sites operated or services performed by Dream Weavers Media (including its subsidiaries, &quot;Dream
        Weavers Media&quot; or &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) constitutes your acceptance of these terms of
        service, as well as the terms and conditions contained in the Privacy Policy and the Community Guidelines.</p>

    <p><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong></p>

    <p>This User Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) applies to all products and services offered by us through any of
        our properties, including plun.asia and kelreport.com, and any country-specific or foreign language versions
        thereof (collectively, the &quot;Network&quot;). In addition, when using particular Network services, you will
        be subject to any guidelines or rules applicable to such services that may be posted from time to time. All such
        guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement. By using the Network, you are
        stating that you understand and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you disagree
        with anything in this agreement, please do not use the Network. You agree that we may change the terms and
        conditions of this Agreement at any time by posting such changes on the Network and that your continued use of
        the Network after any such posting will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the revised terms and
        conditions.</p>

    <p><strong>Registration Obligations</strong></p>

    <p>To use the Network, you may not have to register to become a member (&quot;Member&quot;). As a Member, however,
        you will have access to various services to which non-Members do not have access, some of which will enable you
        and other Members to interact with each other. If you would like to register to become a Member, please complete
        the membership registration form for the appropriate Dream Weavers Media property. You agree to (a) provide
        true, accurate, current and complete information as prompted by the registration form and (b) maintain and
        update such information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete at all times. You are responsible for
        maintaining the confidentiality of any password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that
        occur under your password or account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
        password or account or any other breach of security. If any information provided by you on the registration form
        is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or if we have reasonable grounds to so believe, we have the
        right to suspend or terminate your membership without any right on your part for refund of any fees paid and to
        refuse to provide you with any future membership. If we have reason to believe that you have registered someone
        other than yourself, we will cooperate with any law enforcement investigation that may result from such
        misrepresentations and shall have the right, in our sole discretion, to disclose any information you provided to
        us in connection with such registration. We make a good faith effort to prohibit registration as a Member by,
        and will not knowingly collect or store personal information from, children under the age of 13. In addition,
        please be aware that we have created certain areas on the Network that contain adult or mature content. You must
        be at least 18 years of age to access and view such areas.</p>

    <p><strong>Fees</strong></p>

    <p>We reserve the right at any time to charge fees for access to Network content or services or to portions of the
        existing Network content or services or to the Network as a whole. In no event will you be charged for access to
        any Network content or service, or to the Network as a whole, unless we obtain your prior agreement to pay such
        charges. If you do not consent to such charges, however, you may not have access to paid content or
        services.</p>

    <p><strong>Modifications</strong></p>

    <p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Network (or any part thereof) with
        or without notice. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any such action.</p>

    <p><strong>Network Rules</strong></p>

    <p>Following are some basic rules that apply to the Network and that you agree to follow. If you violate any of the
        Network rules, or if we have reasonable grounds to so believe, we have the right, in addition to pursuing any
        and all legal remedies available, to deny you access to the Network, to suspend or terminate your membership
        without any right of refund to you and to refuse to provide you with any future membership. You agree not to use

    <p><strong>ALLOCATION OF RISK</strong></p>

    <p>You agree that the disclaimer of warranties, limitations on liability, and indemnification provisions set forth

        shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect and be enforced in
        accordance with its remaining terms. The waiver by us of a breach or default of any of the provisions of this

        nor shall any delay or omission on the part of the Dream Weavers Media to exercise or avail itself of any right,
        power or privilege that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver of any breach or default by you. You
        agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may have
        arising out of or related to use of the Network or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such
        claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in this Agreement are solely used for
        convenience and have no legal or contractual significance. All provisions of this Agreement that, by their
        nature, survive termination of this Agreement will survive termination including, without limitation, the
